Hello! I'm Fergy and I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Institute of Science and Engineering, Kanazawa University. I am also currently an Adjunct Assistant Professor at Temple University, Japan Campus.

My current research interests include stationary free boundary and free surface problems, moving boundary problems, geometric inverse problems, and applications of shape optimization methods.
